The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. 
It was developed in the United Kingdom from St. 
John's water dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. 
It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.
